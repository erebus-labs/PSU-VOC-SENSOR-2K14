frack-n-sensor
==============

The frack-n-sensor is a multi-board and software approach to sensor data collection, specifically targetting K20 classrooms - All on an open source HW/SW stack.

The mutli-board solution allows for the independant and decoupled developement of custom sensors, while the open software stack allows custom interpolation of sensor readings. 

- [ ] Note that Some USB Drivers/custom communication drivers still need to be reworked before the entire project can be released under some flavor of Open Source Licensing (e.g. GPL v3?)

All of the Hardware and Software developed is available, keeping in mind that future revisions and use must maintain open source licensing.
